Galleria How-to
===============

The code here is a copy of the Galleria source and
all the development code written for the book.

All the code that is worked on throughout the book
can be found in the development folder.

In case of any corrections, this code is also hosted
on github: https://github.com/vangheem/galleria-workspace

Feel free to create issues for any problems you face
when going through the recipes.
